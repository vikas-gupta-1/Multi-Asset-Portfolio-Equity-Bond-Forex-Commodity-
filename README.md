## Project Overview

This project applies **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to construct and analyze a diversified **multi-asset portfolio** using real financial market data.

The portfolio includes assets across major classes:
- Equities
- Bonds
- Foreign Exchange
- Commodities

Using Python, the project evaluates portfolio risk, return, diversification benefits, and asset correlations over a defined investment horizon. The analysis demonstrates how asset allocation decisions influence portfolio performance and risk exposure.
